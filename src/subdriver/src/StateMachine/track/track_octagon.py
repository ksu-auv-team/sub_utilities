'''
Track_Octagon class

substate of Sub state for tracking the octagon/coffin surfacing task
The idea is to try to stay at the depth halfway between them if possible, head straight for them,
and stop once we get close enough we can see the coffin in the bottom camera.
If we don't know the depth halfway between them, we'll guess as well as we can.

Vars:
    self.oct_det - most recent detection of an octagon
    self.coffin_det - most recent detection of a coffin
    self.center_depth - depth of the halfway point between the objects, if we know it
