# As of 03/09/23 we use an Xbox 360 controller with the joy msg from ROS
# The "joy" message is broken up into 11 buttons and 8 axes
#
#   Default Axes:
#       [0] LLR (Left thumb stick left/right)
#       [1] LUD (Left thumb stick up/down)
#       [2] LT  (Left Trigger)
#       [3] RLR (Right thumb stick left/right)
#       [4] RUD (Right thumb stick up/down)
#       [5] RT  (Right Tigger)
#       [6] DP1  D-Pad??? These are confusing, might be a controller issue
#       [7] DP2  D-Pad??? These might not work???
#
#   Default Buttons:
#       [0] A
#       [1] B
#       [2] X
#       [3] Y
#       [4] LB (Left Bumper)
#       [5] RB (Right Bumper)
#       [6] SELECT
#       [7] START
#       [8] XB (Xbox Button)
#       [9] L3
#       [10] R3

#  So far, although the sub is 6 DOF,
#  we only use 4 DOF and we expect them to be controlled only by axes
#      - Forward/Backwards (FrontBack) Default: RUD
#      - Left/Right (strafe)           Default: RLR
#      - Yaw (AKA rotate)              Default: LLR
#      - Elevation (AKA vertical)      Default: LUD
#
#  we also require you to hold down the arm button the entire time (Note: This should be an axes or maybe make it togglable?)
#      - Arm Default: LT (at least half way down)

arm: "LT"
frontback: "RUD"
strafe: "RLR"
yaw: "LLR"
