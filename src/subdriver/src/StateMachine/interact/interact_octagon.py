interact_octagon.py
Implements the Interact_Octagon class, which inherits from Sub

Will interact with the octagon/coffin surfacing task

Works by centering the sub over the coffin, then climbing while keeping it centered
until we hit the surface. If we lose the coffin, it'll keep going straight up until we hit depth 0 or so.

Will try to thrust just past the surface, in case our depth sensor is miscalibrated, then stop.
I'm expecting we won't do anything after we surface - we're allowed to go back under, but I think this will
be the last thing we do.

I thought about trying to look for the octagon on the surface as we climb, but decided against it.
It'll be hard to see on the surface, it doesn't tell us much about horizontal position, and the
depth sensor is more accurate for vertical position.

Variables:
is_centered - whether we've gotten centered over the coffin. We won't start climbing until we are.
thrust_start_time - the time we started the final thrust up.
